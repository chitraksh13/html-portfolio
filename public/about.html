<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m a passionate Computer Science student at St Joseph's University, Bangalore, eager to explore and build technology that makes a difference. My journey spans full stack web development, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, where I thrive on turning ideas into practical and impactful digital solutions.

I love experimenting with new frameworks, solving real-world problems, and continually expanding my technical skills. Whether it’s building interactive web applications, creating intelligent algorithms, or connecting the physical and digital worlds with IoT, I approach every project as an opportunity to learn and grow.

When I’m not working on tech projects, you’ll find me participating in programming contests, tinkering with hardware, and sharing knowledge with others. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that blend creativity, code, and meaningful user experiences.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!</p>
